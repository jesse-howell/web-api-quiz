# web-api-quiz

## Description

A timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores and gauges my progress compared to my peers.

- My motivation for this project was to create a timed quiz that was quick and easy.
- I built this project to test the skills and knowledge of my peers.
- Due to localStorage, it solves the problem of having to manually grade.
- I learned that localStorage is extremely important to the functionality of many website and webapps.
